To install Docker on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. Update your system

It's a good idea to start by updating your package list to ensure you're installing the latest version of Docker.

/*
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
*/

2. Install necessary dependencies

Docker requires a few dependencies that might not be installed by default on your system. Install them using:

//sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

3. Add Docker's official GPG key

Docker’s official GPG key is required to verify the packages you’re downloading. You can add it using the following command:

//curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

4. Set up Docker's stable repository

Now, add Docker’s official repository to your sources list:

/* 
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
*/

5. Install Docker

With the repository added, update your package list again and install Docker:

//sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

6. Start and enable Docker

Once Docker is installed, start the Docker service and ensure it starts automatically on boot:

*/
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
*/

7. Verify Docker installation

You can check that Docker is installed and running correctly by running:

*/
sudo docker --version
c
*/

This will download and run the “Hello World” container to test if Docker is working properly.

8. Run Docker as a non-root user (optional)

By default, Docker requires root privileges. If you want to run Docker as a non-root user, you’ll need to add your user to the docker group:

//sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

After this, log out and log back in, or simply run newgrp docker to apply the group changes.



To create a Docker network that allows multiple containers (like a load balancer and web servers) to communicate with each other, you can create a custom bridge network. Containers attached to the same custom bridge network can communicate using container names as hostnames.

Here’s how you can do it:
1. Create a Custom Docker Network

To create a custom bridge network, use the following command:

//docker network create --driver bridge my_network 

( sudo docker network ls) to see all networks 
(sudo docker network rm my_network) remove a network
(sudo docker rename web2 web2_old) rename a network
(docker network inspect my_network) inspect a network
(docker container stop <container_name_or_id>) stop a container
(docker network disconnect my_network <container_name_or_id>) disconnect a container from a network

(sudo docker stop "container name") stop a container
(sudo docker rm "remove a container") remove a container
(sudo docker ps -a) verify





This creates a network named my_network. You can use any name you like in place of my_network.

2. Start the Web Servers

Let’s assume you're running multiple web server containers (e.g., Nginx or Apache). For example, let’s create two web server containers:

/*
docker run -d --name web1 --network my_network nginx
docker run -d --name web2 --network my_network nginx
*/

Here, --network my_network attaches each container to the my_network network.

3. Start the Load Balancer

Next, you can create a load balancer container (e.g., using Nginx or HAProxy). Assuming you want to use Nginx as a load balancer:

Create a configuration file for Nginx to load balance between the web servers.

Create a file /* nano nginx.conf */ with something like this:

/*
nginx

http {
    upstream backend {
        server web1:80;
        server web2:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
*/

This configuration tells Nginx to balance requests between the web1 and web2 containers (which are on the same network).

    Run the Load Balancer container:

/*

docker run -d --name loadbalancer --network my_network \
  -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
  nginx

*/

Here:

    --network my_network ensures that the load balancer is connected to the same network as the web servers.
    -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro mounts your custom Nginx configuration file into the container.

4. Test the Setup

Now, the web servers and load balancer should be able to communicate with each other. To test the load balancing:

    Get the IP address of the load balancer:

/*
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' loadbalancer
*/

    Access the load balancer by using its IP address (from a browser or curl command):


//curl http://<load_balancer_ip> ( curl http://172.19.0.2 )


You should see the response from either web1 or web2, depending on the load balancer configuration.
5. Scaling Web Servers (Optional)

If you want to scale the number of web servers (e.g., to 3 web servers), you can create additional containers in the same network:

//docker run -d --name web3 --network my_network nginx

The load balancer (Nginx) will automatically start load balancing across all the web servers (web1, web2, and web3).

6. Verify Container Communication

You can also manually check the connectivity between containers within the network:

/*
docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web1
docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web2
*/

This will test if the load balancer can reach the web servers by their container names.
Summary

    Step 1: Create a custom bridge network using docker network create.
    Step 2: Start your web server containers and attach them to the custom network.
    Step 3: Start the load balancer container and configure it to load balance across the web servers.

            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}

docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' loadbalancer

    Access the load balancer by using its IP address (from a browser or curl command):

bash

curl http://<load_balancer_ip>

You should see the response from either web1 or web2, depending on the load balancer configuration.
5. Scaling Web Servers (Optional)

If you want to scale the number of web servers (e.g., to 3 web servers), you can create additional containers in the same network:

bash

docker run -d --name web3 --network my_network nginx

The load balancer (Nginx) will automatically start load balancing across all the web servers (web1, web2, and web3).
6. Verify Container Communication

You can also manually check the connectivity between containers within the network:

bash

docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web1
docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web2

This will test if the load balancer can reach the web servers by their container names.
Summary

    Step 1: Create a custom bridge network using docker network create.
    Step 2: Start your web server containers and attach them to the custom network.
    Step 3: Start the load balancer container and configure it to load balance across the web servers.
    Step 4: Test the load balancer to verify communication between containers.

Using this approach ensures that your containers can communicate with each other via their container names in a Docker custom network.To create a Docker network that allows multiple containers (like a load balancer and web servers) to communicate with each other, you can create a custom bridge network. Containers attached to the same custom bridge network can communicate using container names as hostnames.

Here’s how you can do it:
1. Create a Custom Docker Network

To create a custom bridge network, use the following command:

bash

docker network create --driver bridge my_network

This creates a network named my_network. You can use any name you like in place of my_network.
2. Start the Web Servers

Let’s assume you're running multiple web server containers (e.g., Nginx or Apache). For example, let’s create two web server containers:

bash

docker run -d --name web1 --network my_network nginx
docker run -d --name web2 --network my_network nginx

Here, --network my_network attaches each container to the my_network network.
3. Start the Load Balancer

Next, you can create a load balancer container (e.g., using Nginx or HAProxy). Assuming you want to use Nginx as a load balancer:

    Create a configuration file for Nginx to load balance between the web servers.

Create a file nginx.conf with something like this:

nginx

http {
    upstream backend {
        server web1:80;
        server web2:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}

This configuration tells Nginx to balance requests between the web1 and web2 containers (which are on the same network).

    Run the Load Balancer container:

bash

docker run -d --name loadbalancer --network my_network \
  -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
  nginx

Here:

    --network my_network ensures that the load balancer is connected to the same network as the web servers.
    -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro mounts your custom Nginx configuration file into the container.

4. Test the Setup

Now, the web servers and load balancer should be able to communicate with each other. To test the load balancing:

    Get the IP address of the load balancer:

bash

docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' loadbalancer

    Access the load balancer by using its IP address (from a browser or curl command):

bash

curl http://<load_balancer_ip>

You should see the response from either web1 or web2, depending on the load balancer configuration.

Using this approach ensures that your containers can communicate with each other via their container names in a Docker custom network.To create a Docker network that allows multiple containers (like a load balancer and web servers) to communicate with each other, you can create a custom bridge network. Containers attached to the same custom bridge network can communicate using container names as hostnames.

Here’s how you can do it:
1. Create a Custom Docker Network

To create a custom bridge network, use the following command:

bash

docker network create --driver bridge my_network

This creates a network named my_network. You can use any name you like in place of my_network.
2. Start the Web Servers

Let’s assume you're running multiple web server containers (e.g., Nginx or Apache). For example, let’s create two web server containers:

bash

docker run -d --name web1 --network my_network nginx
docker run -d --name web2 --network my_network nginx

Here, --network my_network attaches each container to the my_network network.
3. Start the Load Balancer

Next, you can create a load balancer container (e.g., using Nginx or HAProxy). Assuming you want to use Nginx as a load balancer:

    Create a configuration file for Nginx to load balance between the web servers.

Create a file nginx.conf with something like this:

nginx

http {
    upstream backend {
        server web1:80;
        server web2:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}

This configuration tells Nginx to balance requests between the web1 and web2 containers (which are on the same network).

    Run the Load Balancer container:

bash

docker run -d --name loadbalancer --network my_network \
  -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
  nginx

Here:

    --network my_network ensures that the load balancer is connected to the same network as the web servers.
    -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro mounts your custom Nginx configuration file into the container.

4. Test the Setup

Now, the web servers and load balancer should be able to communicate with each other. To test the load balancing:

    Get the IP address of the load balancer:

bash

docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' loadbalancer

    Access the load balancer by using its IP address (from a browser or curl command):

bash

curl http://<load_balancer_ip>

You should see the response from either web1 or web2, depending on the load balancer configuration.
5. Scaling Web Servers (Optional)

If you want to scale the number of web servers (e.g., to 3 web servers), you can create additional containers in the same network:

bash

docker run -d --name web3 --network my_network nginx

The load balancer (Nginx) will automatically start load balancing across all the web servers (web1, web2, and web3).
6. Verify Container Communication

You can also manually check the connectivity between containers within the network:

bash

docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web1
docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web2

This will test if the load balancer can reach the web servers by their container names.
Summary

    Step 1: Create a custom bridge network using docker network create.
    Step 2: Start your web server containers and attach them to the custom network.

http {
    upstream backend {
        server web1:80;
        server web2:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}

This configuration tells Nginx to balance requests between the web1 and web2 containers (which are on the same network).

    Run the Load Balancer container:

bash

docker run -d --name loadbalancer --network my_network \
  -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
  nginx

Here:

    --network my_network ensures that the load balancer is connected to the same network as the web servers.
    -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro mounts your custom Nginx configuration file into the container.

4. Test the Setup

Now, the web servers and load balancer should be able to communicate with each other. To test the load balancing:

    Get the IP address of the load balancer:

bash

docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' loadbalancer

    Access the load balancer by using its IP address (from a browser or curl command):

bash

curl http://<load_balancer_ip>

You should see the response from either web1 or web2, depending on the load balancer configuration.
5. Scaling Web Servers (Optional)

If you want to scale the number of web servers (e.g., to 3 web servers), you can create additional containers in the same network:

bash

docker run -d --name web3 --network my_network nginx

The load balancer (Nginx) will automatically start load balancing across all the web servers (web1, web2, and web3).
6. Verify Container Communication

You can also manually check the connectivity between containers within the network:

bash

docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web1
docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web2

This will test if the load balancer can reach the web servers by their container names.
Summary

    Step 1: Create a custom bridge network using docker network create.
    Step 2: Start your web server containers and attach them to the custom network.
    Step 3: Start the load balancer container and configure it to load balance across the web servers.
    Step 4: Test the load balancer to verify communication between containers.

Using this approach ensures that your containers can communicate with each other via their container names in a Docker custom network.To create a Docker network that allows multiple containers (like a load balancer and web servers) to communicate with each other, you can create a custom bridge network. Containers attached to the same custom bridge network can communicate using container names as hostnames.

Here’s how you can do it:
1. Create a Custom Docker Network

To create a custom bridge network, use the following command:

bash

docker network create --driver bridge my_network

This creates a network named my_network. You can use any name you like in place of my_network.
2. Start the Web Servers

Let’s assume you're running multiple web server containers (e.g., Nginx or Apache). For example, let’s create two web server containers:

bash

docker run -d --name web1 --network my_network nginx
docker run -d --name web2 --network my_network nginx

Here, --network my_network attaches each container to the my_network network.
3. Start the Load Balancer

Next, you can create a load balancer container (e.g., using Nginx or HAProxy). Assuming you want to use Nginx as a load balancer:

    Create a configuration file for Nginx to load balance between the web servers.

Create a file nginx.conf with something like this:

nginx

http {
    upstream backend {
        server web1:80;
        server web2:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}

This configuration tells Nginx to balance requests between the web1 and web2 containers (which are on the same network).

    Run the Load Balancer container:

bash

docker run -d --name loadbalancer --network my_network \
  -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro \
  nginx

Here:

    --network my_network ensures that the load balancer is connected to the same network as the web servers.
    -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro mounts your custom Nginx configuration file into the container.

4. Test the Setup

Now, the web servers and load balancer should be able to communicate with each other. To test the load balancing:

    Get the IP address of the load balancer:

bash

docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' loadbalancer

    Access the load balancer by using its IP address (from a browser or curl command):

bash

curl http://<load_balancer_ip>

You should see the response from either web1 or web2, depending on the load balancer configuration.
5. Scaling Web Servers (Optional)

If you want to scale the number of web servers (e.g., to 3 web servers), you can create additional containers in the same network:

Using this approach ensures that your containers can communicate with each other via their container names in a Docker custom network.


To run two web server containers (using basic NGINX containers) and ensure that both are running and part of a custom Docker network, follow these steps:

1. Create a Custom Docker Network

First, create a custom Docker network. This will allow the web servers to communicate with each other:

//docker network create --driver bridge my_network

This command creates a network named my_network.

2. Run the First Web Server (Nginx)

Now, run the first web server container using the official NGINX image and attach it to the custom network (my_network):

//docker run -d --name web1 --network my_network nginx

Explanation:

    -d: Run the container in detached mode (in the background).
    --name web1: Name the container web1.
    --network my_network: Attach the container to the my_network network.
    nginx: The NGINX image (Docker will pull it from Docker Hub if not present).

3. Run the Second Web Server (Nginx)

Now, run the second web server container (again using the official NGINX image) and attach it to the same custom network:

//docker run -d --name web2 --network my_network nginx

Explanation:

    --name web2: Name the container web2.

4. Verify the Containers are Running

Check that both containers are up and running:

//docker ps

You should see both web1 and web2 listed in the output. Each should have the nginx image, and both should be connected to the my_network network.

5. Verify the Containers are Part of the Custom Network

Check if both containers are part of the custom network my_network. Use the following command to inspect the network:

//docker network inspect my_network

This command will display detailed information about the network, including which containers are connected to it. Both web1 and web2 should be listed under the "Containers" section.

6. Test the Web Servers

To confirm that both web servers are running and accessible:

    Access the first web server:

    You can use curl to check the response from web1:

*/
	curl http://localhost:8081
*/

Or, access it in your browser at http://localhost:8081.

Access the second web server:

You can use curl to check the response from web2:

/*
    curl http://localhost:8082
*/
  
    Or, access it in your browser at http://localhost:8082.

7. (Optional) Expose Ports for External Access

If you want to access these web servers via different ports on your local machine, you can run the containers with exposed ports. Here’s how:


/*
docker run -d --name web1 --network my_network -p 8081:80 nginx
docker run -d --name web2 --network my_network -p 8082:80 nginx
*/

This maps port 8081 on your host to port 80 on web1, and port 8082 on your host to port 80 on web2.

8. Test External Access

Now you can test both servers by accessing them through your web browser or curl command:

/*
    For web1: http://localhost:8081
    For web2: http://localhost:8082
*/

Summary of Steps:

    Create a custom network: docker network create --driver bridge my_network
    Run two NGINX containers: docker run -d --name web1 --network my_network nginx and docker run -d --name web2 --network my_network nginx
    Check that the containers are running: docker ps
    Check the containers are connected to the custom network: docker network inspect my_network
    Access the containers using curl or a browser to confirm they're up and running.

Now you have two web server containers running, both connected to a custom Docker network!


To set up an NGINX load balancer on Ubuntu that balances traffic between two web servers (which are running in Docker), follow these steps:

1. Create a Directory to Store NGINX Configuration

First, create a directory where you will store the NGINX configuration for the load balancer. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

/*
mkdir -p ~/nginx-load-balancer/conf.d
*/

2. Create the NGINX Load Balancer Configuration

Now, create the NGINX configuration file for load balancing. You can use a simple nginx.conf that specifies the upstream servers (web1 and web2) and a proxy setup.

Create the file nginx.conf inside the ~/nginx-load-balancer/conf.d directory:

//nano ~/nginx-load-balancer/conf.d/nginx.conf

Paste the following content into the file:

/*

http {
    upstream backend {
        # Load balancing between web1 and web2 containers
        server web1:80;
        server web2:80;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
}

*/

This configuration:

    Defines an upstream group named backend with two servers (web1 and web2).
    Balances the traffic between web1 and web2 using round-robin (default behavior).
    Proxies incoming HTTP requests to the backend servers.
    Sets headers that are typically useful for logging and handling proxy-related details.

3. Run the NGINX Load Balancer Container

Now that you have the configuration file ready, run the NGINX load balancer in Docker and link it to the custom network (my_network), which also contains the web server containers.

Use the following docker run command:

/*
docker run -d --name loadbalancer --network my_network \
  -v ~/nginx-load-balancer/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro \
  -p 8080:80 nginx
*/

Here’s what this command does:

    -d: Run the container in detached mode (in the background).
    --name loadbalancer: Names the container loadbalancer.
    --network my_network: Attaches the load balancer to the custom network my_network.
    -v ~/nginx-load-balancer/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d:ro: Mounts your NGINX configuration directory into the container.
    -p 8080:80: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container, so you can access the load balancer on your local machine.

4. Verify the Load Balancer is Running

Check that the NGINX load balancer container is running:

//docker ps

You should see the loadbalancer container in the output, running and attached to the my_network network.

5. Test the Load Balancer

To test if the load balancer is working, use curl or your browser to access the load balancer:

/*
curl http://localhost:8080
*/

You should receive a response from one of the web server containers (web1 or web2). If you run the command multiple times, the load balancer should distribute the traffic between the two servers (round-robin by default).

Alternatively, access the load balancer using your browser:

/*
    Go to http://localhost:8080
*/

If everything is working correctly, the load balancer should forward requests to either web1 or web2 and return their responses.

6. Test Container Communication

If you want to check that the load balancer can communicate with the web1 and web2 containers by their names, you can exec into the load balancer container and ping the web servers:

/*
docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web1
docker exec -it loadbalancer ping web2
*/

You should get a successful ping response from both containers.

Summary of Steps:

    Create a directory: mkdir -p ~/nginx-load-balancer/conf.d
    Write the NGINX configuration: Create nginx.conf with load balancing configuration between web1 and web2.
    Run the load balancer: Start the NGINX container with the configuration file mounted, connected to the my_network network.
    Test the setup: Use curl or a browser to access http://localhost:8080 and verify traffic balancing between web1 and web2.

Now you have a functioning NGINX load balancer container that balances traffic between your two web servers (web1 and web2).


To access the NGINX load balancer in your browser and confirm that traffic is being distributed between the two web servers, follow these steps:

1. Get the IP Address of the Load Balancer Container

First, you'll need to find the IP address of the NGINX load balancer container within the custom Docker network (my_network). You can do this by running the following command:

//docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' loadbalancer

This will output the internal IP address of the load balancer container in the custom network. It should look something like 172.18.0.2, but the exact address may vary.

2. Access the Load Balancer in Your Browser

Now that you have the internal IP address of the load balancer container, you can access it from your browser. Since we mapped the container's port 80 to host port 8080, you can access the load balancer via the following URL:

/*
	http://<load_balancer_ip>:8080
*/

For example, if the IP address of your load balancer container is 172.18.0.2, you would enter this URL in your browser:

/*
	http://172.18.0.2:8080
*/

However, note that this will only work if you are using the IP address from inside the Docker network. If you're accessing from the same host (your Ubuntu machine), it's easier to access the load balancer via localhost or 127.0.0.1 on port 8080, like so:


/*
	http://localhost:8080
*/

3. Refresh the Page to Test Load Balancing

    Open your browser and navigate to /* http://localhost:8080 */
        The page should load, and you should see a response from one of the web servers (web1 or web2).

    Refresh the page multiple times (F5 or Ctrl+R in most browsers).

        Each time you refresh, the load balancer will forward the request to one of the backend web servers (web1 or web2). Since we're using round-robin load balancing (the default behavior of NGINX), you should see the traffic alternating between web1 and web2.

        You can confirm this by inspecting the response (e.g., different content, if you have different configurations in each server) or by checking the server logs.

4. Verify Traffic Distribution

If you set up web1 and web2 to serve different content (e.g., different index pages), refreshing the page will show different responses from time to time.

If both servers are serving the same content (default NGINX page), you can verify load balancing by:

    Checking the server logs for each container to see which one is receiving the request, or
    Adding a simple, unique message to each web server (e.g., using a custom HTML page or index.html in each container).

Example:

    Access via browser:

    http://localhost:8080

    Refresh the page multiple times:
        The response will switch between web1 and web2 based on NGINX’s round-robin behavior.

This confirms that the load balancer is distributing traffic between the two web servers (web1 and web2).


To configure the NGINX load balancer to perform health checks for the web servers and ensure traffic is sent only to healthy servers, you need to modify the NGINX configuration to include health check directives in the upstream block.

NGINX does not have native support for active health checks in the standard version, but you can enable passive health checks using max_fails and fail_timeout. With passive health checks, NGINX considers a server as "unhealthy" if it fails to respond a certain number of times within a specified time window, and it will stop sending traffic to that server.

For active health checks, you would need NGINX Plus, which is the commercial version of NGINX. However, I will show you how to implement passive health checks using the standard NGINX configuration.
Steps to Add Health Checks to NGINX Load Balancer

1. Modify the NGINX Configuration

Open your NGINX configuration file on the host (~/nginx-load-balancer/conf.d/nginx.conf) and modify the upstream block to include passive health checks.

/*
nano ~/nginx-load-balancer/conf.d/nginx.conf

Replace the existing upstream block with the following:

nginx

http {
    upstream backend {
        # Define the web servers with health checks
        server web1:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
        server web2:80 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
}
*/

Explanation:

    max_fails=3: This directive specifies the number of failed attempts before NGINX considers a server to be "unhealthy."
    fail_timeout=30s: This defines how long (in seconds) NGINX will consider a server "unhealthy" after the maximum number of failures. In  this   case, if the server fails 3 times in 30 seconds, NGINX will stop sending traffic to it until it becomes healthy again.

2. Update the Load Balancer Container

After updating the NGINX configuration, you need to restart the NGINX load balancer container to apply the changes.

Run the following commands to restart the load balancer container:

//docker restart loadbalancer

3. Testing Health Checks

To test that the health checks are working and that traffic is only routed to healthy servers, follow these steps:

    Simulate an Unhealthy Server: You can temporarily stop one of the web server containers (web1 or web2) to simulate an unhealthy server.

    For example, to stop web1:


//docker stop web1

Check the Load Balancer Behavior:

    Refresh your browser or use curl to test the load balancer:

/*
    curl http://localhost:8080
*/

    The load balancer should no longer send traffic to the stopped (unhealthy) server, and it will only send traffic to the healthy server (web2).

Check the Health Check Behavior After Recovery: Once the failed server (web1) has been brought back online, it will be marked as healthy, and the load balancer will start sending traffic to it again.

To restart web1:

//docker start web1

    Observe the Load Balancer Again: After restarting the web1 container, refresh the page again. The load balancer should begin sending requests to both web1 and web2 once web1 is healthy.

4. Check the NGINX Logs (Optional)

To further investigate whether the load balancer is marking servers as unhealthy and recovering them, you can check the NGINX logs inside the container:

//docker logs loadbalancer

This can give you insight into the internal behavior of NGINX with regard to the health checks.
Summary of Changes:

    NGINX Configuration:
        Added max_fails and fail_timeout in the upstream block to perform passive health checks.
    Testing:
        Stopped one of the web servers to simulate an unhealthy state.
        Verified that the load balancer stopped sending traffic to the unhealthy server.
        Restarted the unhealthy server and observed that the load balancer started sending traffic to it again.

This method ensures that your NGINX load balancer will only send traffic to healthy web servers. Keep in mind that this is a passive health check setup. If you need active health checks, you would need to use NGINX Plus.
